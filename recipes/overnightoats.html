    <h3>Sweet Breakfast</h3>
    <p>A tasty sweet and healthy filling breakfast</p>
    <p>Preparation/Cook time - 10 minutes</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup old fashioned rolled oats</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk, any milk will work, but I like unsweetened almond milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plain yogurt or Â¼ cup more milk, I like using Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons maple syrup or honey, or your preferred sweetener</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chia seeds, optional</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, optional</li>
        <li>pinch of sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oats, milk, yogurt, maple syrup, chia seeds, vanilla and sea salt into a jar or storage container with a lid. Stir
        ingredients together. Place in the fridge overnight. If you're in a rush you can shorten the soak time to 2-4 hours</li>
        <li>The next morning (or when ready to eat), remove lid and give oats a big stir. If they seem too thick you can add a
        little more milk to loosen the mixture. Top with your favorite toppings and enjoy. You can eat the oats straight from
        the jar or pour into a bowl for serving.</li>
        <li>Overnight oats should last up to 5 days in the fridge in a sealed airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
